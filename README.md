## justification

Why another typing website?

1. No ads.
1. Values _accuracy_ first, then speed.

When you have to go back to the beginning every time you type the wrong key, the session becomes more like trying to land a trick on a skateboard, and less like grinding along on a treadmill.

It trains you to prioritize accuracy - nobody cares how fast you can run into a brick wall.

## how might I change this thing?

### choose-able text

### choose-able fonts

How would this work? Would the user paste in a google-fonts URL (would this even work)? Would you present a limited menu of options?

### "heat-map" of typing speed per character

Calculate time to stroke each key - use that duration to color in the typed characters.

This would (?) let the user look back and have a quick impression of where they sped up or slowed down.

### Avatar

Have like a little fighter avatar who kicks and punches the letters away as you chew through text.

When you type a wrong letter, the avatar gets knocked out.
