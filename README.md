Why another typing site?

- No ads.
- Values _accuracy_ first, then speed.

When you have to go back to the beginning every time you type the wrong key, the session becomes more like trying to land a trick on a skateboard, and less like grinding along on a treadmill.

It trains you to prioritize accuracy - nobody cares how fast you can run into a brick wall.
